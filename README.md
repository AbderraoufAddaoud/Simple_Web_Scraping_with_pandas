# Simple_Web_Scraping_with_pandas
In this project, we analyze Game of Thrones viewership using web scraping and pandas.


The project successfully demonstrated the process of web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization using pandas and Plotly. Tables from a Wikipedia page were extracted and combined into a single DataFrame. The 'U.S. viewers (millions)' column was cleaned and converted to a numeric type. Visualization techniques were employed to create bar charts that display U.S. viewership trends across episodes and seasons.

Analysis of the data revealed that the number of views per season increased from season 1 to season 8, with the final season having the highest number of views. This indicates a growing interest and audience engagement in the series over time. This project provides valuable insights into the viewership patterns of Game of Thrones episodes.
